# The-Importance-of-Handwashing

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: He discovered handwashing. Contaminated hands were a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. In the environment we currently find ourselves in, with basic handwashing practice returning to the forefront, I revisit its origins to better understand its potential effectiveness. 

In this python project I reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.
